The goal of the project is to spiritually revie, the wild west of the old internet that has slowly eroded over the last two decades. My guess is that short urls on tinurl (5 character ones) typically link to old stuff. Whack some urls, and post anything interesting you find on twitter, make sure to cc me [@yvanscher](https://twitter.com/yvanscher)!

some examples of urls i whacked:
